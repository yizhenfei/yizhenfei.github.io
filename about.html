    Why living dangerously?

  <p class="ld-quote">
    For believe me: the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and greatest enjoyment is - to live dangerously.

  <p class="ld-quote">
    Meaning and morality of one's life come from within oneself. Healthy, strong individuals seek self expansion by experimenting and by living dangerously. Life consists of an infinite number of possibilities and the healthy person explores as many of them as possible. Religions that teach pity, self-contempt, humility, self-restraint and guilt are incorrect. The good life is ever changing, challenging, devoid of regret, intense, creative and risky.

    I agree with Nietzsche that 'The secret of a joyful life is to live dangerously.' A joyful life is an active life, ..., such is the life of the man who risks safety and happiness for the sake of growth and happiness.
